# Example project with Vue.js and Storyblok

> In this example you can see how you can integrate Storyblok - an Api-based CMS - in a Vue.js project.
> Imagine you have a single page application and want some pages editable with a CMS. This is now possible with Storyblok.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
